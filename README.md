METRICSTICS 

The development of a ”METRICSTICS” subsystem that is integrated into the Cricket Match
Information System (CMIS) for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and presenting statistics
about player’s performance.The subsystem must be seamlessly accessible within CMIS and userfriendly
for match analysts, coach and cricket fans. METRICSTICS aims to provide comprehensive
player statistics to improve engagement, performance assessment, and decision-making. Coaches
and fans can evaluate the information that has been recorded by analysts.METRICS should be
able to perform optimally in any scenario.


Here are the key statistics generated by METRICSTICS:

Minimum (m): The smallest value within the dataset. 

Maximum (M): The largest value within the dataset. 
Mode (o): The value that appears with the highest frequency in the dataset. (o may not be unique.)

Median (d): If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle values.

Arithmetic Mean (μ): The average value of the dataset.

Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): A measure of the average absolute difference between each data point and the dataset's mean.

Standard Deviation (σ): A measure of the dispersion or spread of the dataset.
